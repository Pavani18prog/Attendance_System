# 🏫 AI-Driven Automated Attendance System using Python and OpenCV

An **intelligent attendance management system** that uses **face recognition** to automatically capture and record attendance in real time. Say goodbye to manual roll calls and spreadsheets!

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Face Detection & Recognition** – Captures faces and marks attendance automatically.  
- **Accurate Records** – Stores **name, date, and timestamp** for each attendance entry.  
- **Daily CSV Reports** – Generates a new **CSV file each day** for easy tracking and record keeping.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Built with **Tkinter GUI** for intuitive registration and live attendance display.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – Face detection and recognition  
- **Tkinter** – GUI interface for interaction  
- **CSV** – Storing and managing attendance data  

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Register faces and personal details through the GUI.  
2. The system captures live video feed and recognizes registered faces.  
3. Attendance is recorded automatically and saved in a **daily CSV file**.  
4. Live attendance is displayed in a **tabular format** on the interface.
